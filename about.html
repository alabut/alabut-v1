    				<blockquote><p>
    				    <span class="quotemark">&ldquo;</span>Not everything is design, but design is about everything.<span class="quotemark">&rdquo;</span>
    					<cite> - Michael Bierut</cite>
    				</p></blockquote>
    				<h3>The Tools I Use And Why</h3> 
    				<h4>A Clean Design Aesthetic</h4>
    				<ul>
    				    <li> design is how something <em>works</em>, not just how it looks.</li>
    				    <li> good design has a strong point of view and streamlined minimalism has just as much of a <em>soul</em> as any other design approach.</li>
    				    <li> balancing minimalism and information density is the never-ending struggle.</li>
    				</ul>
    				<h4>User Research And Usability Testing</h4>
    				<ul>
    				    <li> none of the other tools matter if you don't understand what <em>they</em> want.</li>
    				    <li> the web is such a new medium
    					that it's still easier to flip through a magazine than to use a computer.</li>
    					<li> on average, people take about fifteen seconds (at most) to judge a new
    					site and whether it's useful.</li>
    					<li> simple and easy-to-use things aren't made for idiots, but the opposite - smart people with a lot to do.</li>
    				</ul>
    				<h4>XHTML/CSS</h4>
    				<ul>
    				    <li> designing a site means caring just as much about what goes on <em>under</em> the hood.</li>
    					<li> you want your site to be
    					seen by as many people as possible, whatever browser they use today and will be
    					using tomorrow.</li>
    					<li> you should be able to easily modify and add to your website
    					over time, rather than let the html calcify and become harder to change.</li>
    				    <li> web pages were meant for search engines as much as they were for
    					people.</li>
    					<li> people don't wait around for slow-loading pages, especially
    					if they're on fast connections.</li>
    				</ul>
    				<h4>Flash/Actionscripting</h4>
    				<ul>
    					<li> Timeline-based animation has its place on the web - it's just not the <em>only</em> role
    					    for Flash anymore and programmers can make it sing for all kinds of things.</li>
    				    <li> Flash can be an incredibly powerful <a href="http://flashprototyping.com/"
    				    title="website by my friend David Overholt on how to prototype quickly using Flash">prototyping tool</a>.</li>
    				    <li> When built right and used smartly, Flash can be useful and interesting,
    				        lightweight and fast-loading, customizable and flexible, backwards-compatible and browser-friendly.</li>
    				</ul>

    				<h6>Child actor syndrome</h6>
    				<p>I started programming when I was 6, learned 
    					Logo, BASIC, FORTRAN, Pascal and C by the end of high 
    					school, quit programming before college and
    					went on to be a pre-med student, all before Netscape Navigator.</p>

    				<h6>I am web designer, hear me roar!</h6>
    				<p>It may be rooted in other mediums, but
    					<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingwebdesign">web design is its own craft</a> and more similar
    					to product design and architecture than anything else.</p>
    				<p>I'm a usability purist <strong>and</strong> fan of great design, so I appreciate both
