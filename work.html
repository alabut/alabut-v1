        				<p><a href="http://asterpix.com" title="Asterpix Interactive Video - Video with Annotations">Asterpix</a> is a startup with a very unique video player &#8212; it uses advanced object recognition algorithms so that you can attach notes to any object in a video. Designing a UI for this new &#8220;popup video&#8221; was challenging. How would we preserve the playback experience and make videos that people can watch like they're already used to, while also getting across that they can interact with them and do more than just watch?</p>
                        <p>After doing an extensive audit of competing niche video players and finding most of them to be overly complex, I finally found inspiration for the new functionality from the best non-video sites: Flickr, Google Maps, and Youtube.</p>

                    	<p>The overall layout is roughly the same, although the controls themselves have changed a little. The top bar has become a bit more crowded, with a dropdown to select different video sources and a button to choose different types of annotation alerts. The navigation pane is now transparent, making the notes difficult to read and the button to slide out the side pane a bit less obvious.</p>

                        <h4><a name="asterpix2">2. site and logo design</a></h4>
                    	<p>Since the concept of watching and interacting with &#8220;hypervideos&#8221; was so new, the site itself needed to be as easy to use as possible and easily communicate this new type of interaction in layman's terms.

        Accomplishing these usability and learnability goals translated to two concrete graphic design strategies:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><em>minimal graphics, navigation elements and &#8220;administrative debris&#8221;, placing the emphasis on the videos.</em></li>
                            <li><em>an extensive help section with prominent links to it throughout the site.</em></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The logo and navigation bar were made vertically narrow to give the video player breathing room, while the Boy Scout-like color scheme of blue, white and muted gold was chosen for a neutral unobtrusive feel. On the home page, huge unmissable text in the middle of the screen clearly gets across that this isn't a video site like you might be used to.</p>
                        <dl>
                            <dt><img alt="" src="images/work/asterpix_homepage.png" /></dt>
                            <dd>original home page (July 2007)</dd>
                        </dl>
                        <dl class="inset">

                        </dl>
                    	<p>To reinforce the interactive nature of the videos, both the motto and the large welcome graphic on the home page incorporated the term &#8220;hypervideo&#8221;, with a link from the banner text to an explanation and tutorial in the help section. Also, the logo is a large asterisk, a nod towards the similarity between the role of the annotations in the video and footnotes in a book.</p>
                    	<p>The typeface for the company name is FF Meta, a sans-serif originally developed in 1984 for the German Federal Post that implies a bit more class and professionalism than the typical trendy rounded fonts in the &#8220;web 2.0&#8221; look. The motto is set in Silkscreen, a bitmap font that is easy to read at small sizes and gives a small hint of the advanced tech under the hood.</p>
                        <dl class="inset alt">
                            <dt><img alt="" src="images/work/asterpix_sidebar_original.png" /></dt>

                        </dl>
                        <p>Also unusual was the fact that the sidebar had to get across both that there are multiple versions of each video, as well as the fact that each video was originally from another website altogether. I used a small batch of icons to get across the various states (your video, group videos, and locked versions of other people's videos) as well as prompts for visitors to create their own.</p>
                        <p>The metadata section was kept short&#8212;the intent was to focus attention on the notes in the videos, not peripheral stuff that they could and should find out about elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>The graphics for the logo and company name are the same, but the motto has been swapped out with a new one set in a much blurrier typeface that loses the crispness of the previous typeface.</p>
                        <p class="clear">And sadly, the large intro text on the home page is much smaller and uses vague verbiage rather than plain language, among a few other poor design choices.</p>

                    	<p>Overall, the website has followed the same general trend as the video player and become a bit more cluttered, growing new UI elements in the (quite intentional) gaps of the original layout.</p>
                    	<p><em>One lesson I've taken from this project is that lots of whitespace, big font sizes and plain language is a very opinionated graphic design approach and takes guts to both create and maintain.</em></p>

                        </dl>
                    	<p><strong>On a positive note</strong>, they've taken a page from Youtube's playbook by introducing content in the sidebar that's more exploratory and likely to get visitors to stick around longer. This is an obvious oversight in retrospect and a definite improvement.</p> -->

                    	<p>Before the site launched publically, the product manager and I ran usability tests using a group of local high school students. After analyzing the major obstacles, it became clear that the biggest hurdle for most people (even tech-savvy youth) was not about how to use the video player and attach notes to objects, but understanding that the videos were interactive and realizing that they could do anything other than just watch them.</p>
                    	<p>Based on this, we produced two short videos explaining the unique aspects of the Asterpix player and its advanced object recognition. The screencasts provide a much better introduction than either reading the text-heavy FAQ pages or diving right into watching an Asterpix video.</p>

<!--                     	<h5>Update: where are they now?</h5>
        	            <p>The videos are still there and pretty much the same, with only minor changes: there's a different narrator (the script, visuals and timing are still the same) and the videos are displayed one at a time in a tabbed interface, rather than side-by-side.</p>

        				</h2>
        				<p>This was a short project for Kevin Reeth, a friend of a friend and co-founder of <a href="http://esomnie.com/" title="Esomnie - Ruby on Rails and Web 2.0 development">Esomnie Software</a>, a Rails consultancy that transitioned into making their own products, much like <a href="http://37signals.com" title="Simple small business software, collaboration, CRM: 37signals">37signals</a> did in 2001. <a href="http://paybackable.com/" title="Simple Online Expense Reports">Paybackable</a> was one of their first apps, a mileage and expense tracker that aimed to simplify the typically complex process of expense reporting.</p>

        				<p>Their initial web app gathered acclaim and started building an audience, yet was visually sparse and basically a functional demo for their concept.</p>

                        <p>After talking to Kevin for an afternoon about what pain points they were trying to solve, I agreed to build out a quick redesign of a single page, the public-facing home page, to see if we could focus the branding and design to clearly communicate what they were all about.</p>
                        <dl class="superbanner">

                        </dl>
                        <p>The logo and header type were set in <a href="http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/diavlo.html" title="Diavlo :: a Free Quality Font from exljbris">Diavlo</a>, a new sans-serif that is a bit square and sharp. It does the tough job of communicating both a Hevetica-like professionalism while also injecting some fun and personality, without stooping to the cartoonish level of a MS Comic Sans brush script.</p>
                        <p>More importantly, I added a clear visual hierarchy, differented the logo from the body content, and highlighted both the main selling points and the registration prompt with giant buttons, all of which was lost in a maze of plain text before.</p>
                    	<p><em>This project taught me the importance of heuristics&#8212;you don't have to test every design in advance in order for it to be an improvement, sometimes you can simply rely on your training, instinct and past experience to create something better.</em></p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to work on a side project while already working at a startup full-time. Luckily, they found another designer to overhaul Paybackable and the end result is also an improvement from the initial version, plus they've applied the visual treatment to other apps like <a href="http://gobootstrap.com/" title="Simple online bookkeeping software">Bootstrap</a> and unified their product line.</p>

                                <p>Social Media was one of many startups focused almost exclusively on Facebook following the launch of the developer platform in the spring of 2007 and quickly became a strong contender on the back of their massively popular stat-tracking application for developers, reborn from an earlier version on Myspace. Social Media also created apps and made a self-serve ad network, which had Adsense-like self-service and CPC features, unlike the old school banner ads on most other apps.</p>
                                <p>It was an exciting and fast-moving environment to be in&#8212;I made a Facebook app on my first day on the job! Having the machinery in place to make apps quickly meant that we were able to go from scribbling ideas on napkins in the morning to reviewing mockups in the afternoon and then finally handing off to a programming team that built it by the next day.</p>

                                <p>One realization I had early on was that the consequence of being able to make so many apps was dispersion&#8212;a lot of related apps could benefit from being bundled together and also needed a bit of visual consistency to look like they were made from the same shop. At the same time, it was a possibility that we might start using the same virtual currency across apps.</p>
                                <p>The solution I came up with was a common toolbar-style header that was customized for each app: </p>

                                <p>This header wasn't intended just for fun timewasters, it would act as a toolbar for the developers already using Appsholic by showing them a suite of apps related to tracking their traffic and ad spending.</p>

                                <p>Did I mention it was a fast-paced environment? Six weeks after joining them, Social Media landed their Series A funding and decided to drop the app-making side of their business altogether, focusing only on building out their ad network. It was probably a good move for the business at the time&#8212;the self-service ad network is their key differentiator and brings in a lot of revenue, no matter how fun the apps were to build and use.</p>
